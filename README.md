# Welcome!

## Ice Cream Shop

Welcome to the Ice Cream Shop Discord bot! This bot is mostly a bot I made for fun while I was testing how efficient I could make an idle bot and how the logistical issues behind an idle bot. Please know that the bot is "actively" being worked on and there may be some data resets depending on how I like each database schema.

And just for the reference, I put actively in quotation marks because I am a busy high school senior who has not yet worked on their college essay and is currently very far behind on their summer work. I still love developing though, so not all hope is lost!

To get started with the bot, please visit the Get Started page!

## Contributing

On the other hand, if you would like to help out the Ice Cream Shop in its development, the bot is **completely open-source**. You can find a link to the Github repo [here](https://github.com/Nickanda/IceCreamShop).
